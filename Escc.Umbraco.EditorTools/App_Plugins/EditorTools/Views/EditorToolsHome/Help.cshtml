                                                The 'Users' tool is designed to be a quick an easy way to view all of the active and disabled users in your umbraco installation.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This is particuly useful if a user is struggling to log in. For example they may have forgotten their username or believes their account to be disabled for some reason (Umbraco disables a user account after several failed login attempts). When not being used to troubleshoot login problems it is also a useful audit tool to see how many users you have.

                                                The 'Content' tool queries the examine indexes and the content service for your umbraco installation and creates a table of all of your published and unpublished content. This tool is particulary handy for audit purposes. If your site is particularly large the generation of data can take at least a minute, but is then cached for future use.
                                            </p>

                                                On each table for your content you are provided with the ID, Name, published url and a link to the edit page for each content node.
                                            </p>

                                                You can see some basic statistics about all your content pages such as your total pages and a table of your document types.
                                                The process then goes a step further and generates a table for each document type to allow you to quickly view all the pages that fall under that type. On each table you can view basic information such as the pages name, id and published url. Your also provided with a link to each pages edit page.

                                                The 'Page Expiry' tool allows you to view all the pages in your umbraco installation that are published and have either an expiry date or are set never to expire (they have no expiry date).
                                            </p>

                                                The first time the tool is opened it might take some time to load as the tool queries the content service to find expiry dates. However, once loaded, the data is cached to avoid having to do the query again. If you believe the tables to out of date you can click refresh to update the cache.
                                            </p>

                                                This tool is particuly useful for audit purposes and to quickly find out what pages are expiring and when or which pages will never expire.

                                                Developers: This tool also makes use of Examine, so if you wish to speed up this tool you can add an "expireDate" UmbracoProperty to your document types that copies the ExpiryDate and allows it to be indexed by Examine (<a href="https://github.com/east-sussex-county-council/Escc.Umbraco.Expiry">Escc.Umbraco.Expiry</a> can do this for you). 
                                                If a result returned by examine doesn't have this property the process then queries the content service which causes an overall slow down.

                                                The 'Examine Search' tool takes your search terms and queries the Examine indexes for your umbraco installation.

                                                Using the drop down list you can choose to either search for media files or content pages. The results are then returned to you in a table which contains the closest results that examine could find.

                                                Both queries for either media or content allow for multiple search terms and will score the results returned to you.

                                                On particularly large websites the process will take a minimum of 30 seconds to create the CSV file. However once generated the file is cached allowing you to immediately download the file again.
